# MTG-Stats
A collection of codes for analysing MTG deck statistics

There are two chunks of code: The first chunk uses existing cEDH decks, and can be used to tweak those decks to check the effect on Ad Nauseams.

The commented out chunk is used for manual input of deck statistics. However, the input only takes in CMC up to 6, so you will need to add more input lines to cater for larger CMCs.
